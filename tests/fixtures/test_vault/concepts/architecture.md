# System Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture approach.

## Layers

1. Domain Layer - Pure business logic
2. Application Layer - Use case orchestration
3. Infrastructure Layer - External adapters
4. API Layer - HTTP handlers

## Design Principles

- Dependency Inversion
- Single Responsibility
- Interface Segregation

See [[migration]] for how this applies to the database migration project.
